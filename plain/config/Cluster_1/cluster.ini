;; This is the network address the master server will listen on for other shard
;; servers to connect to. Set this to 127.0.0.1 if all of your servers in your
;; cluster are on the same machine, or 0.0.0.0 if the servers in your cluster
;; are on different machines. This only needs to be set for the master server,
;; either in cluster.ini, or the master server's server.ini.
;; Overridable in server.ini
;; Default: 127.0.0.1
;; Required: If shard_enabled = true and is_master = true
bind_ip = 127.0.0.1

master_ip = 127.0.0.1

;; This is UDP port that the master server will listen on, and that a

;; cluster.ini, or omitted completely to use the default.
;; Overridable in server.ini
;; Default: 10888
master_port = 10888

;; This is a password used to authenticate a slave server to the master. If you
;; are running servers on different machines that need to connect to each other
;; , this value must be the same on each machine. For servers running on the 
;; same machine, you can just set this once in cluster.ini.
