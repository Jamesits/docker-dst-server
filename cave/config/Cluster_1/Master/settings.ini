;; server.ini, and false in every other server.ini.
;; Default: none
;; Required: If shard_enabled = true
is_master = true

;; This is the name of the shard that will show up in log files. It is ignored
;; for the master server, which always has the name [SHDMASTER].
;; Default: none
;; Required: if shard_enabled = true and is_master = false
name = Master

;; This is field is automatically generated for non-master servers, and is used
;; internally to uniquely identify a server. Altering this or removing it may
;; cause problems on your server if anybody’s character currently resides in
;; the world that this server manages.
;; Default: Randomly generated number.
;; id = 0

[NETWORK]
;; The UDP port that this server will listen for connections on. If you are
;; running a multi-level cluster, this port must be different for each server.

;; the same LAN to see it in their server listing. Ports below 1024 are
;; restricted to privileged users on some operating systems.
;; Default: 10999
